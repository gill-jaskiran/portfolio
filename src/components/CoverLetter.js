            Java, PHP, Linux, SQL, Python, HTML and CSS. I have taken intensive Linux courses
            which have well-prepared me to work within Linux environments using shell scripts,
            particularly Bash. I have taken courses such as Database Management, in which I
            have worked in various SQL Servers such as Oracle and MySQL workbench. Furthermore,
            my bachelorâ€™s degree, Advanced diploma, and work experience have honed my
